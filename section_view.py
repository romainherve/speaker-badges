"""Cross-section through one corner screw of the assembled badge, to verify the
M2 cap head seats on the lid counterbore shoulder and the shaft engages the
brass insert. A 1.2 mm slab is cut on the screw axis and each part sliced
individually (Compound '&' only slices one body), then recombined.

Read bottom->top in the default 'right' view: cap head (hex socket) recessed in
the lid counterbore -> Ø2.4 shaft through the lid -> knurled insert in the boss.
The head (Ø3.8) is wider than the through-hole (Ø2.4), so it cannot pull through.
