"""Diagnostic: do the two shells actually interfere when the case closes?

Builds front + back in the assembled position (same transform as
assembled_view.py), intersects them, and reports the overlap volume and
where it sits. Also reports the Z-span of each shell's pocket walls so we
can see the gap (or overlap) across the mid-plane seam.
